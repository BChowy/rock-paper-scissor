# rock-paper-scissor but they're spells

## Project Overview

This project is a simple game like rock-paper-scissor but I changed it into more magical options. I'm planning to add more features in the future.

## Motivation

I've been interested in learning web development for a while now, and I did this project for "The Odin Project".

## Progress

I've completed the basic functionality of the game, including showing different results based on the 'spells' cast. I'm currently working to add more colors and images for the spells.

## Learnings

- Learned how to get a random element from an array.
